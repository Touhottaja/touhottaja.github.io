Hi there internet dweller, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub pages site acts as a central place for me to collect my projects and thoughts into.

## BUSBER
Bad USB Buster (busber for short) is a simple tool for checking if a USB device is malicious by collecting keypress events from it, if it sends any. The tool is far from perfect, so use at your own risk. Should be good enough to be used on sacrificial devices, such as Raspberry Pi.

### Demo
