- [Hack the Box - Codify](https://github.com/Touhottaja/hacking_playground/blob/main/writeups/htb_codify/htb_codify.md)
- [Hack the Box - Beep](https://github.com/Touhottaja/hacking_playground/blob/main/writeups/htb_beep/htb_beep.md)

## Exploring malicious NFC tags
I found unprotected NFC tags at a gym and wrote a short blog-type README about how they could be abused. See it [here](https://github.com/Touhottaja/hacking_playground/blob/main/blog/malicious_nfc.md).
